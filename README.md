# Skin-Detection

This is a computer vision approach to detect hands in a controlled environment. 
A range of skin colors are selected and compared with the colors of a query image. 
As result, an area is calculated indicating the amount of pixels occupied by the hands.
This method has some limitations such as being susceptible to strong light changes and similar colors in the background.
